Tableau Citi Bike Project Notes

1)	There is so much data to go through. My plan was to ETL data for 2014, 2016, 2018 & 2019. 
2014 has 8MM records, 2016 has 13MM records, 2018 has 17MM records and 2019 had 21MM 
records. The tableau public tool only allows a maximum of 15MM records. I found that out the 
hard way.

2)	My next approach (that worked) was to select a month from each year. I chose July from 2013 
through 2020. The collective data resulted in 12.2MM records. I had a success with being below 
the 15MM records maximum.

3)	My first group of observations and analysis focused on the year over year growth in month of 
July from 2013 through 2020 for the number of trips/rentals. There was 159% growth from 2013 
through 2019. 2020 numbers were flat, but the trip duration was up. I believe that the Covid-19 
virus impacted both of those numbers for 2020. I show a trend line to predict the growth going 
forward.

4)	My next group of observations reviewed the average trip distance on a year over year basis for 
the July months of 2013 through 2020. I would say that the data was consistently around 1.15 
miles per trip. The exception was for 2020, the average trip distance went over 1.3 miles per 
trip. I believe this a result of the Covid-19 Virus too. Bike riding provided a different form of 
entertainment.

5)	My next group of observations reviewed the average trip time on a year over year basis for the 
July months of 2013 through 2020. The average trip duration average around 1000 minutes. 
2020 the average trip duration jumped to almost 1600 minutes. I also believe this is a result of 
the Covid-19 Virus too. Bike riding provided a different form of healthy entertainment.

6)	Next, I started reviewing the popularity of the starting stations and the ending stations. Station 
ID 519 is the most popular starting station and especially for male riders. ID 426 is the most 
popular station for female riders. I show a map of the most popular start stations too.

7)	Then I reviewed that popularity of the end stations. It was interesting to me that the end 
stations popularity was reversed from one and two from the start stations. 426 is the most 
popular end station. 519 was the most popular start station. I included a map of the end stations 
and I show the popularity of those stations too.

8)	Up next, I reviewed the P75 quartile data of the trip distance verses the driver ages. I see a small 
drop of the average distance as age from 24 through 48 and the drop continues from 52 and 
older. What is strange is there is a jump for riders at the age from 49 through 51.  51-year-old 
riders have a big jump to over 1.7 miles in their average trips. I decided to use the P75 as a level 
to help with capacity planning.

9)	Then I looked at average age of the On-Demand Customers verses the Subscriber customers and 
the split by gender. I also added the trip counts into this view. Male Subscribers take the most 
trips on the bikes. Both Male and Female Subscribers have about the same average age at 
around 37-38 years of age. The On-Demand Customers seem to average 30-31 years of age for 
both males and females. Subscribers take many more trips than the On-Demand Customers.


10)	I also looked at the number of trips and trip durations for Subscriber Customers and On-Demand 
Customers. The growth was about the same rate for both groups. For 2020, there was a 
decrease of all Customers in number of trips and an increase in trip duration for 2020, especially 
for the On-Demand customers. I believe that is also a result of the Covid-19 virus and biking 
became a method of entertainment along with the exercise. 

11)	Next, I looked at the number of trips by gender. The increase by gender matched the overall 
increase on a year over year basis. 2020 was again an exception. Female and unknown trips 
were up, and male trips were down. Again, the trip time duration was up for 2020 even thou the 
over trips/rentals were down.

12)	The next look at the data shows the trips by station with a look at the preference by gender. 
Males preferred to start from station 519 and females preferred to start from station 426. I 
believe that the majority unknowns are most likely females, so the interest in station 426 as the 
start station needs to be explored and possibly developed/exploited. I have also provided a map 
that shows the interest by gender in the most popular starting stations.

13)	Then I started digging to the usage by the bike ID. I Look at the top 15 bike IDs and show the 
total trips. The top bikes show heavy trips 2016 and 2018. Then I looked at the total trip distance 
by bike ID. Five Bike IDs showed very heavy usage in 2016. Not sure if these bike IDs had bad 
data or they were heavy favorites of certain patrons.

14)	Overall, the popularity of the Citi Bike business and usage has tremendous growth. If the New 
York City government continues to support bicycle usage in the city, I could expect that City 
Bikeï¿½s growth will continue at its current rates. That is with the expectation that Citi Bike 
continues with investment and exceptional customer service. From the data I reviewed, Citi Bike 
has a nice business that provides a great service.
